There are many great developers out there and there are many great writers out
there. Even though I do not consider myself being part of the intersection of
these two sets, I want to use this blog to give away certain things that I come
across when working/studying/etc. and which I find noteworthy. Probably this
won’t happen on a regular basis, but I’ll do my best to come up with something
new every now and then.
